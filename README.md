# Working-w-Forms-Agenda

To run the project you need to have Microsoft Visual Studio installed. If you don't have it and want to see my work, here is a link where you can download it directly from Microsoft: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/es/vs/community/

Once you have it installed and you are on the home page, you must click on the button that says "Open project", locate the place where you downloaded my project and you only have to click on the button that says "Run" at the top of the page. interface
